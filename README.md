# Music and the soul of imagination

One of the beautiful music I have ever heard is the song of the soul. I never had to deliver the application of all the compiled songs, but one of these is the digital art of Gorillaz. I knew everyone already heard of the band. How about Adele? Guess you already knew who she is.

I’ve compiled the details of the song in a short application called – Music and the soul of the imagination. Using various tools such as <a href="http://manvanmove.co.uk/">man and van poole</a>, audio tool, and build in platform music, the cloud of this song is listed.
